# WRLD3D-Task

The task was to create an Android app, using the WRLD3D Android SDK, which will have a screen with a map centered to the California Academy of Sciences building (San Francisco, CA) in which an indoor marker must be placed (hardcoded) in the Academy Cafe (1st floor).
The user should be able to navigate to the indoor view, navigate through floors and see the marker.
